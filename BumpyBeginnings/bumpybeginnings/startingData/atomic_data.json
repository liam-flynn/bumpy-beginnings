    "subtitle": "Most people know pregnancy (morning) sickness is a common symptom in pregnancy. Here are some others that you may not be aware of.",
    "text": "<p><strong>1. Bleeding gums in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Have you noticed your gums bleeding when you brush your teeth? Bleeding gums in pregnancy could be a condition called gingivitis. Hormones can make your teeth more vulnerable to plaque, leaving you with swollen, bleeding gums.</p>\n<p>These are some things you can do to take extra care of your smile when you&rsquo;re pregnant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>book a dentist appointment</li>\n<li>ask your dentist about getting a professional clean</li>\n<li>brush your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes</li>\n<li>avoid sugary and acidic drinks and foods</li>\n<li>stop smoking &ndash; there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/smoking-and-pregnancy/get-help-stop-smoking\">lots of support available</a>&nbsp;if you need it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/early-pregnancy/morning-sickness-and-hyperemesis-gravidarum\">pregnancy (morning) sickness</a>, rinse your mouth with water after being sick &ndash; try to wait an hour before you brush your teeth (they&rsquo;ll be softened by the acid in your tummy).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don't forget to ask your midwife for a maternity exemption certificate. This will let you get free dental care and prescriptions during pregnancy and for 1 year after your baby&rsquo;s birth.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Leg cramps in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Cramps can be common in pregnancy. Leg cramps are sudden, sharp pains, usually in the lower leg.</p>\n<p>It may help to try to stretch your leg and move your ankle up and down during a cramp. Gentle stretches and trying not to point your toes down when lying down may help prevent cramps.</p>\n<p>Speak to your midwife or GP if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leg cramps are disturbing your sleep&nbsp;</li>\n<li>you have numbness or swelling in your legs</li>\n<li>cramps last longer than 10 minutes</li>\n<li>if you have any other symptoms or concerns.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people get&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/restless-legs-syndrome\">restless legs syndrome</a>&nbsp;in pregnancy, usually in the third trimester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Feeling faint in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Been feeling slightly dizzy or faint? This may be due to hormonal changes, low blood pressure &nbsp;or getting too hot (see next symptom). Here are some useful tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get up slowly after sitting or lying down</li>\n<li>as soon as you feel faint, find a seat quickly &ndash; if the faintness doesn&rsquo;t pass, lie down on your side.</li>\n<li>turn on your side if you feel faint while lying on your back (It&rsquo;s best to sleep on your side when you reach your third trimester.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/sleep-side/sleep-side-pregnancy-campaign\">Research shows that this can reduce the risk of stillbirth</a>.) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Talk to your midwife or doctor if you are feeling dizzy or faint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Feeling hot in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Your body pumps more blood in pregnancy, which alongside hormones can make you feel hot. It may help to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use a desk fan for work and your bedroom</li>\n<li>carry a small, battery-operated fan around with you</li>\n<li>wear loose, breathable fabrics</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/nutrition-in-pregnancy/how-much-water-should-i-drink-pregnancy\">stay hydrated</a>&nbsp;and always have a bottle of water with you</li>\n<li>take a dip in a refreshing bath or go for a swim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/ask-a-midwife/why-do-i-feel-cold-pregnancy\">feel colder during pregnancy</a>. This does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong. But if you have any concerns, it&rsquo;s always best to call your midwife or doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Headaches in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Headaches can be common in early pregnancy and usually improve as your pregnancy progresses. It may help to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>try and rest when you can</li>\n<li>keep hydrated</li>\n<li>find ways to relax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paracetamol is safe to take in pregnancy. Make sure you only take the recommended dose and take it for the shortest possible time.&nbsp;<strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;take codeine or ibuprofen &ndash; unless prescribed by your doctor. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Call your midwife, GP or maternity unit if you have a severe headache that does not go away. This can be a sign of pre-eclampsia, which can cause serious complications in pregnancy.</p>\n<p>6. Indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy</p>\n<p>Hormones and, later in pregnancy, your womb pressing on your stomach can cause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>heartburn &ndash; a painful burning feeling in the chest, often after eating</li>\n<li>feeling full and bloated</li>\n<li>nausea (feeling sick)</li>\n<li>burping and farting</li>\n<li>bitter-tasting fluids into your mouth or bringing up food.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some things you can do that may help relieve your symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make a note of what makes you feel worse and avoid these foods, especially in the evenings (spicy foods, chocolate and fruit juice are often to blame)</li>\n<li>eat a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/nutrition-in-pregnancy/balanced-diet-pregnancy\">healthy, balanced diet</a></li>\n<li>try eating smaller meals often</li>\n<li>sit up straight when you&rsquo;re eating to take the pressure of your stomach</li>\n<li>finish eating about 3 hours before bedtime</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/smoking-and-pregnancy\">don&rsquo;t smoke</a>&nbsp;(there is support available if you need it)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/eating-well-pregnancy/alcohol\">don&rsquo;t drink alcohol</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speak to your midwife or GP if your heartburn is severe and the ideas above don&rsquo;t help you feel better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7. Swollen ankles, hands and feet in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Your body holds more water in pregnancy, which can move towards the lowest parts of your body making your ankles, hands and feet swell. Try to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>avoid standing for long periods of time</li>\n<li>prop your feet up so they&rsquo;re higher than your heart for about an hour each day</li>\n<li>wear comfortable shoes and socks</li>\n<li>do some stretches such as pointing your toes down and releasing upwards 30 times, then circle each foot 8 times&nbsp;</li>\n<li>drink lots of water</li>\n<li>take some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/being-healthy/exercise\">gentle exercise</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Call your midwife, GP or maternity unit if you have a sudden increase in swelling, particularly in your hands face or feet. This can be a sign of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/pre-eclampsia-information-and-support\">pre-eclampsia</a>, which can cause serious complications in pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>8. Constipation in pregnancy</strong></p>\n<p>Pregnancy hormones can play havoc with your digestive system, leaving you constipated. Here are some tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough fibre. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables, pulses, wholemeal breads and cereals.</li>\n<li>Drink plenty of water.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Stay active. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be strenuous. Regular light or moderate exercise, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/exercise-in-pregnancy/walking-and-pregnancy\">walking</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/exercise-in-pregnancy/swimming-pregnancy\">swimming</a>&nbsp;may help.</li>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re taking iron supplements (which can make you constipated), talk to your GP about your options.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Talk to your midwife or GP if you are still struggling with constipation after making these changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>9. Diarrhoea</strong></p>\n<p>Diarrhoea in pregnancy can be caused by hormone changes, a tummy bug or food poisoning. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-symptom-checker/diarrhoea-and-vomiting-pregnancy\">diarrhoea in pregnancy</a>&nbsp;and how to look after yourself.</p>\n<p>Loperamide (also known as Imodium or dioraleze) is not usually recommended in pregnancy. This is because there is not enough information to say whether it is safe or not.&nbsp;<strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;take this medicine to treat diarrhoea without speaking to your midwife or doctor first. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rarely, diarrhoea can be caused by an infection called listeria, which can be dangerous in pregnancy. Speak to your midwife, doctor or NHS 111 if you have diarrhoea and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-symptom-checker/high-temperature-pregnancy\">high temperature</a>&nbsp;of 38C or above</li>\n<li>aches and pains</li>\n<li>chills</li>\n<li>are feeling or being sick.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find out more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/infections/infections-pregnancy\">infections in pregnancy</a>&nbsp;and how to avoid them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10. Piles</strong></p>\n<p>Some women get piles during pregnancy. These are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom. Anyone can get piles, but they happen in pregnancy because hormone make your veins relax.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of piles can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>itching, aching, soreness or swelling around your anus</li>\n<li>pain when passing a stool (faeces, poo) and a mucus discharge afterwards</li>\n<li>a lump hanging outside the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool</li>\n<li>bleeding after passing a stool &ndash; the blood is usually bright red.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Piles can cause constipation. Try to drink plenty of water and eat plenty of fibre such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wholemeal bread</li>\n<li>fruit</li>\n<li>vegetables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist about how to manage piles. Don&rsquo;t use a cream or medicine without checking with them first.&nbsp;</p>",

    "subtitle": "You and baby just met, and suddenly they're all yours. Those first couple days at home can be nerve-racking. How will you know if something’s wrong?",
    "text": "<p>Most newborns are perfectly healthy, and your parenting instincts kick in pretty quickly, so chances are you&rsquo;d know if there was a serious problem. Of course, you can call the doctor any time you&rsquo;re even a little concerned. But you should&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> pick up the phone if you notice any of these issues.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Fever<br></strong>No, you don&rsquo;t need to check baby&rsquo;s temperature if everything seems fine, says Janelle Aby, MD, medical director of the Well Baby Nursery at Lucile Packard Children&rsquo;s Hospital Stanford and clinical associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. But you should if there are other symptoms (especially those below) you&rsquo;re worried about, or baby&rsquo;s skin feels warm or cool to the touch. For a newborn, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-fever\" target=\"_blank\">fever</a> is considered 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher; a temperature is too low if it&rsquo;s under 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit and also warrants a call to the pediatrician.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Baby Won&rsquo;t Eat or Isn&rsquo;t Peeing<br></strong>Newborns shouldn&rsquo;t refuse to eat, says Aby, especially if two to three hours have gone by since the last feeding. Check baby&rsquo;s diapers. If the number of wet ones decreases, they could be dehydrated.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Yellowish Skin or Eyes<br></strong>If baby&rsquo;s skin or eyes become increasingly yellow, they have jaundice, which means they have high levels of bilirubin (a naturally occurring substance that gives bile that yellowish color) in their blood. In mild cases, baby&rsquo;s jaundice will go away on its own with plenty of feedings, but in more severe cases, baby may need light therapy treatment at the doctor&rsquo;s office or hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood or Weird-Looking Spit-Up<br></strong>Two more symptoms Aby says to look out for are green spit-up (could signal an intestinal problem) and blood pretty much anywhere (including poop, spit-up and around the circumcision area). In those cases, &ldquo;baby needs to be evaluated promptly in case treatment is necessary,&rdquo; she urges.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>When Not to Worry<br></strong>Okay, we told you what&rsquo;s most concerning. Now, here&rsquo;s what might seem scary but isn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a pink-orange smudge in the diaper<br></strong>This may look like blood but it&rsquo;s not. &ldquo;The discoloration, which can appear in the pee-soaked area, is caused by urate crystals which are normally present in urine,&rdquo; says Aby. &ldquo;Usually the color disappears after the first week or so when urine flow increases.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Or even a</strong>&nbsp;<em>little</em><strong> blood<br></strong>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the one exception to the general rule of &lsquo;worry if anything is bleeding,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Aby. Some baby girls have vaginal bleeding that starts three to five days after birth and continues for a few days. It&rsquo;s caused by the change in hormone levels due to her birth. Blood should only be about the size of a nickel or quarter, Aby says. And while it&rsquo;s not cause for concern, if it concerns you, you can still have the pediatrician confirm it&rsquo;s normal bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Baby&rsquo;s eyes look crossed<br></strong>Especially when baby is sleepy, you might notice their eyes&rsquo; alignment is a little off. &ldquo;Newborns have relatively weak eye muscles, so babies who are less than two months old will often have moments when their eyes cross or diverge,&rdquo; Aby says. Only if you still notice it happening at six months is it an issue.</p>",

    "title": "How Do I Help My Mad Toddler Express Anger in a Healthier Way?",
    "subtitle": "Ask Your Mom expert Emily Edlynn tells us how we can help toddlers through their temper tantrums.",
    "text": "<p>When my 3-year-old toddler gets mad, she looks at me with squinted eyes, clenched teeth, and sometimes growls. It's evident she is very angry, and seems to get angry quite often when she doesn't get her way or is told \"no.\" Before, she would hit and kick. I was able to get her to stop doing that by allowing her to use her expressions to show anger, but now we are here. What is the best way to help her express her anger in a healthy way&mdash;Angry Toddler Problems<br><br></p>\n<p>I am going to reframe your situation: Your 3-year-old shows self-control&nbsp;and progress that you both should be proud of. Your work with her has clearly paid off. At her age, growling with an angry face&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;expressing anger in a healthy way because no people or property are harmed in the process.</p>\n<p>I suggest switching up the question: \"How do I&nbsp;<em>keep</em> helping her express anger in healthy ways?\" What you continue to do with her during these angry episodes matters as her brain develops emotional regulation skills with every passing day of big feelings and not getting exactly what she wants.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Why Is Anger Management Tough To Teach?</strong></p>\n<p>I have noticed in my work with families, and in real life knowing anyone parenting children, that anger can be our toughest emotion to navigate. Our childhood experiences with adults expressing anger can play out with our own children. Seeing our child's anger may be an emotional trigger for those whose caregivers blew up easily, or unfamiliar territory for those whose caregivers withdrew and went silent when angry, communicating that expressing anger&nbsp;is not permitted.</p>\n<p>Because anger makes us uncomfortable for a range of reasons, we often convey to our children to express emotions, except anger. If we get more comfortable with anger as a natural human emotion, we help our children embrace their own, eventually without hurting anyone&mdash;or growling.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Anger and the Young Brain</strong></p>\n<p>The young child has the brain parts to feel strong emotions suddenly, but not yet the brain development to harness these emotions. In working with children in my therapy office, I start with the basics of emotions with almost every child regardless of age, like noticing how they feel in their bodies, labeling the feelings, and then articulating emotions to eventually replace exploding behaviors.</p>\n<p>In my years of therapy practice and motherhood, I can attest that young children most often do not have the ability to calmly state how they are feeling when angry. It's too complex for their brains. Doing so entails:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noticing</li>\n<li>Stopping a strong impulse</li>\n<li>Having insight</li>\n<li>Being able to put words to a highly emotional experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Side note: How many adults do you know who struggle with this?)<br><br><br></p>\n<p><strong>How To Manage Expectations</strong></p>\n<p>There's a very important concept from child development critical for your dilemma: scaffolding. This refers to helping our children build important skills in a way that matches the skills they already have, and their readiness to level up.</p>\n<p>You have done this by helping your daughter replace destructive acts of anger&nbsp;with facial expressions and vocalizations that express her anger safely. It sounds like you see the next level as replacing this type of expression with behavior that feels more socially appropriate.</p>\n<p>Because it is probably a high bar for a 3-year-old to express anger calmly with words, I recommend focusing on two goals as the next developmental steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physically regulating strong emotion</strong>: This coping skill will help dial down the intensity of anger, giving her emotional regulation tools to last a lifetime.</li>\n<li><strong>Becoming comfortable with her anger</strong>: Adults and other caregivers will be her greatest emotional teachers in this regard. Work on modeling this good behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Co-Regulation is Key</strong></p>\n<p>This may sound a bit fancy, but self-regulation is actually one of our most powerful strategies for emotional health: learning to calm our bodies when in distress. Regulating with your daughter, called co-regulation, helps her feel how her nervous system shifts from high alert to calm. High alert, which happens when we feel intense emotions like fear and anger, can include a racing heart, heated up body temperature, tense muscles, and rapid breathing.</p>\n<p>When my son gets heated, sometimes I take his hand in mine, put it on his chest, and simply say, \"feel your heart right now.\" When toddlers get mad, they need us to regulate with them, which means&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;need to be regulated (calm). When we stay calm and offer physical comfort like hugging, sitting them on our laps, or holding hands, our calmer nervous systems help their little bodies better regulate those big emotions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Modeling Anger Acceptance</strong></p>\n<p>The next greatest gift you can offer as a parent is modeling that anger is an acceptable emotion. We achieve this by showing that we are comfortable with our children being angry. This means avoiding two common traps: talking them out of their anger and becoming overwhelmed by it ourselves.</p>\n<p>Our youngest children's anger can look quite ridiculous on the surface, so it's easy to say, \"this is so not a big deal&mdash;calm down!\" (I've done it.) When possible, however, validating \"you're angry because you're not getting what you want and that is really hard,\" offers empathy that goes a long way.</p>\n<p>I've had my share of moments wanting my kids to just&nbsp;<em>stop</em> being upset, but I've learned how important it is to stick in there with the distress as often as I can and to resort less often to shutting down the anger (my own yelling)&nbsp;&nbsp;or escaping it (tuning out with some Facebook scrolling). Just like when they are sad and you sit next to them rubbing their backs while they cry, you can show them they can feel angry and get through it: \"I see you are really angry. I'm here when you're ready to sit in my lap.\"</p>\n<p>Note: We accept all emotions, but not all behaviors. While they are angry, we continue supporting safety. \"It's fine to be angry, but not to punch me.\"</p>\n<p>Once their bodies are calm, you can then guide dialogue about what made them mad, how it felt, and what helped it pass. This helps children practice self-awareness, identify coping strategies, and build confidence that anger passes, just like the scariest thunderstorms eventually end.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>\n<p>With time, practice, and buckets of patience, I promise your daughter will progress beyond the angry animal stage. Accepting the emotion of anger itself while you work on expression skills at each developmental stage will prepare her well for long-term emotional health. She's fortunate to have such a wise and invested parent, even if you get angry about her anger sometimes. After all, you're both only human, and at least she knows you'll always be there for her. Even when she growls.</p>",
